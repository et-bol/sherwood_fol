                Welcome to the Friends of the Sherwood Public Library website.
                As our name implies we are in existence to provide support and
                funding for programs that will benefit the library and the
                community of Sherwood. The Friends are a private, Non-Profit
                501c3 corporation.

                <h4>A Bit of History</h4>
                    <p>
                        The minutes show that in the summer of 1936 Mr. Morris
                        became the first officially elected president of the
                        Library Association, taking the place of Margaret Adair,
                        chairman pro tem, 1935, who then became the first
                        librarian. Mr. Morris presided over three meetings.
                        Was then followed by Kathryn Haines. The parents had
                        been meeting informally for a little more than a year,
                        beginning in 1935, and book shuttling between Sherwood
                        and the State Library had been going on during that
                        time to provide some of the needed reading for the older
                        students.

                    Friends of the Sherwood Public Library was formally defined
                    and organized by librarian Lavern Will and the Sherwood
                    Public Library Board of Trustees on April 2, 1975. Friends
                    was founded to encourage voluntary service for the city
                    library, and to provide materials, equipment and services
                    for the library beyond the reach of the library's regular
                    budget.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These activities are funded from the sale of used books
                    through the book shelves located in the public library, by
                    donations, memorials, and Friends of the Sherwood Library
                    membership dues; and by the sale of library T-shirts and
                    book bags.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    We encourage all individuals who enjoy the facilities and
                    services offered by the Sherwood Library to join the Friends
                    of the Library.
