                The Friends work with the library to determine what programs, services, and material needs we can provide that will add value to the overall experience that library patrons receive. Our recent contributions include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Summer Reading program performers</li>
                <li>Author Readings</li>
                <li>Automated book checkout</li>
                <li>Backstops for shelving</li>
                <li>Children's Story Time</li>
                <li>Open House for city staff refreshment</li>
                <li>Writing Workshops</li>
                <li>Music in the Stacks</li>
                <li>Video Display</li>
                <li>Movable Book Display</li>
                <li>Adult Storytelling events</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Funding for these projects come from the loyal support of community members, organizations and of course our used book sale through the book shelf located inside the library.<br><br>

                The Friends rely on the community for 100% of the funding that helps support the library. With the exception of minor expenses for postage and printing all of the funding we receive goes back to the library. When making a contribution other than membership you can specify where you would like your money spent. Please consider making the Friends a part of your annual contribution budget.<br>
